Watch M.E. are a medical technology startup based between Newcastle, U.K. and Montr√©al, Canada. We make activity trackers for medical emergencies. They detect crises, such as heart attacks and strokes, through medical data such as ECGs and then send GPS coordinates and medical data to family, friends and medical services.
